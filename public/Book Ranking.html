<h1>The Best Books According to Jayson</h1>
<h2>My top 3 books of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lie with me, by Philippe Besson</h3>
<p>One of the most heartbreaking queer fiction I have ever read. The melancholy, the sweet taste of an unrealized love, forbidden by social prejudice of the 80s. And suicide, let's not talk much about it.</p>
<h3>The Psychology of money, by Morgan Housel</h3>
<p>This book will change your perspective of money, through lessons learned from different individuals with different backgrounds.</p>
<h3>Reasons to stay alive, by Matt Haig</h3>
<p>When life is down and you feel blue, read this book.</p>
